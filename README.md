Small stuff I automated using Python for my lazy self
Note: to use, please edit the directories to match those of your own system

general tools: pyperclips, shutil, ...
mostly I used selenium, bs4, requests and webbrowser modules for webscraping

For excel Spreadsheets, I used openpyxl
more to come
